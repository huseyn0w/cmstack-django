"""Comment submission and moderation services.

The single home for comment business logic, reused by the public submission view
and (later) the REST/MCP surface. Follows the house service style used by
``apps.search.services``: plain functions, typed params, plain return values; no
HTTP request/response objects leak in. Views only map the returned outcome to an
HTTP response — they hold no comment domain rules themselves.
